Hey there!

I'm trying to build a reactive circuit using my Arduino Uno from scratch! So far, all of the reactive circuits I've built have come from the Arduino Projects Book, and I want try something for myself.

The Stab Bot 5000 is a circuit that reacts to shadows moving across a photoresistor by sending a servo into a (stabbing) frenzy!

After the circuit works as intended, I'm going to make a little body and arm for my ferocious buddy out of cardboard, to bring it to life!
